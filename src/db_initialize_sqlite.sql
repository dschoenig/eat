Most often equal probability sampling is used: e.g. all forests in North America have the same chance of being randomly selected. Unequal probability sampling can be used to ensure representativeness of result, e.g. if a forest in the south of the area is selected, the selection of the next forest far away from the first will be favored. Unequal probability sampling can also mean that forests easy to access obtain a higher selection probability. Probability sampling is important in addition to representative sampling (question 4).
