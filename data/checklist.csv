1,"Internal validity","Research aim","Does the study address a clearly focused question?","See main text, section 'setting question and the context'"
2,"Internal validity","Research aim","Does the question match the answer?","Answers may not directly correspond to the originally formulated question, e.g. 'Does hunting lead to genetic changes in the moose population of North America?' is answered by: 'hunting reduces the size of calves'. The missing match is obvious when question and answer are written next to each other, but in publications with much text in between it may be more difficult to identify. The result of reduced calf size may be interesting, but special care should be taken while assessing the evidence base."
3,"Internal validity","Data collection","Was the population/area of interest defined in space, time and size? ","'Population/area' is the target, we aim to say something about; e.g. North America's moose population. "
4,"Internal validity","Data collection","Selection bias: Was the sample area representative for the population defined?","Usually samples are not taken from the whole population/area; e.g. only several North American forests were selected to measure moose. Were the selected forests representative? Did they cover the north, south, east and western part of North America? "
5,"Internal validity","Data collection","Was the sample size appropriate? ","Were the criteria used to determine the sample size (e.g. power calculation) reasonable?"
6,"Internal validity","Data collection","Was probability/random sampling used for constructing the sample?","Probability sampling means random sampling with known selection probabilities for all objects in the population, while nonprobability sampling does not involve random selection (Trochim, 2014; SÃ¶derqvist and Soutukorva, 2009). Most often equal probability sampling is used: e.g. all forests in North America have the same chance of being randomly selected. Unequal probability sampling can be used to ensure representativeness of result, e.g. if a forest in the south of the area is selected, the selection of the next forest far away from the first will be favored. Unequal probability sampling can also mean that forests easy to access obtain a higher selection probability. Probability sampling is important in addition to representative sampling (question 4). "
7,"Internal validity","Data collection","If secondary data were used, did an evaluation of the original data take place?","Secondary data, such as used in cost-benefit transfer for example, need to be evaluated to make sure that the data used are not prone to bias."
8,"Internal validity","Data collection","If data collection took place in form of a questionnaire, was it pre-tested/piloted?","Questionnaires need to be professionally designed to ensure that they measure what they intend to measure. Therefore a questionnaire should be pre-tested/piloted on a smaller sample size to test its performance (see Rattray & Jones 2007)."
9,"Internal validity","Data collection","Were the data collection methods described in sufficient detail to permit replication? ",
10,"Internal validity","Analysis","Were the statistical/analytical methods described in sufficient detail to permit replication? ",
11,"Internal validity","Analysis","Is the choice of statistical/analytical methods appropriate and/or justified?",
12,"Internal validity","Analysis","Was  uncertainty assessed and reported?",
13,"Internal validity","Results and Conclusions","Do the data support the outcome? ","Are the conclusions drawn of the analytical results valid?"
14,"Internal validity","Results and Conclusions","Magnitude of effect: Is the effect large, significant and/or without large uncertainty?","This question aims to identify the magnitude and precision of results. Precise results are usually characterized by low uncertainty (CEBM 2010) and in combination with a large effect the appropriate statistical analysis (question 11) will lead to a significant result. Not all studies allow the judgment of all three aspect and we therefore combine them in one question and recommend context specific decisions."
15,"Internal validity","Results and Conclusions","Are all variables and statistical measures  reported?",
16,"Internal validity","Results and Conclusions","Attrition bias: Are non-response/drop-outs given and is their impact discussed?",
17,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Is there a low probability of publication bias? ","An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g. funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken) (CEBM 2010). If no quantitative analysis is included, discussion of possible publication bias can be sufficient."
18,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Is the review based on several strong-evidence individual studies?","Most ideally every included study should be assessed for its level of evidence. Several strong evidence individual studies should be included to achieve strong evidence in the review. See main text for further details."
19,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Do the studies included respond to the same question?",
20,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Are results between individual studies consistent and homogeneous?",
21,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Was the literature searched in a systematic and comprehensive way?",
22,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Was a meta-analysis included?","The term 'meta-analysis' has been vaguely defined in ecology and conservation (Vetter et al. 2013). In this context we do not talk about any summary analysis (e.g. vote counting), but an explicit meta-analysis as defined by Vetter et al. 2013 or Koricheva et al. 2013"
23,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Were appropriate a priori study inclusion/exclusion criteria defined?",
24,"Design-specific aspects","Review","Did at least two people select studies and extract data?","At least two people should select papers and extract data. There should be a consensus procedure to resolve any differences (CEBM 2010). In most cases it is too costly to extract data from every paper twice. It might be sufficient to follow the consensus procedure for the first few studies."
25,"Design-specific aspects","Study with a reference/control","Allocation bias: Was the assignment of case-control groups randomized?",
26,"Design-specific aspects","Study with a reference/control","Were groups designed equally, aside from the investigated point of interest?",
27,"Design-specific aspects","Study with a reference/control","Performance bias: Was the sampling blinded? ","Blinding means that e.g. researchers taking samples of a specific area wouldn't know the differences between these areas. "
28,"Design-specific aspects","Study with a reference/control","Were there sufficient replicates of treatment and reference groups?",
29,"Design-specific aspects","Study with a reference/control","Detection bias: Were outcomes equally measured and determined between groups?","Beside the importance to design groups equally (Question 26), the outcome has to be measured equally. This is necessary to avoid a bias due to the measurement method."
30,"Design-specific aspects","Observational studies","Were confounding factors identified and strategies to deal with them stated?","Controlled studies have equally designed groups (Question 26). Observational studies can not be so easily controlled for potential confounders. It is therefore particularly important to identify them and discuss strategies to avoid biasing results."
31,"Focus-specific aspects","Quantification","Is the unit of the quantification measurement appropriate?",
32,"Focus-specific aspects","Quantification","Was temporal change (e.g. annual or long-term) of quantities measured (e.g. species abundance or an ecosystem service) discussed?",
33,"Focus-specific aspects","Valuation","If discounting of future costs and outcomes is necessary, was it performed correctly?","Discounting ecosystem services is less straightforward than discounting purely economic values. Nevertheless, it has to be considered when talking about future values (TEEB 2010, ch.6)"
34,"Focus-specific aspects","Valuation","If aggregate economic values for a population were estimated, was this estimation consistent with the sampling and the definition of the population?","Individual values are summed up to total economic values (TEV), for example in cost-benefit analysis. This should be done thoroughly (e.g. avoiding double counting, considering system boundaries...)"
35,"Focus-specific aspects","Management","Was the aim of the management intervention clearly defined?",
36,"Focus-specific aspects","Management","Were side effects and trade offs on other non-target species, ecosystem services or stakeholders considered?",
37,"Focus-specific aspects","Management","Were both long-term and short-term effects discussed?",
38,"Focus-specific aspects","Management","Did monitoring take place for an appropriate time period?",
39,"Focus-specific aspects","Management","Appropriate outcome measures: Are all relevant outcomes measured in a reliable way?","Ideally the outcome, e.g. increase in biodiversity, is measured according to an evidence-based quantification or valuation tool."
40,"Focus-specific aspects","Governance","Were long-term effects assessed?",
41,"Focus-specific aspects","Governance","Was the policy instrument that was used described?",
42,"Focus-specific aspects","Governance","Was the influence of the applied policy instrument (incentive/law) on the society discussed?",
43,"Focus-specific aspects","Governance","Appropriate outcome measures: Are all relevant outcomes measured in a reliable way?","Ideally the outcome, e.g. increase in biodiversity, is measured according to an evidence-based quantification or valuation tool."
